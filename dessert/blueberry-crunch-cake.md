preheat oven to 350

Ingredients:

* 1 -  28oz can crushed pineapple (1 large and 1 small can if 28oz can is not available)
* 3 to 4 cups of blueberries (fresh or frozen)
* 3/4 cups of sugar
* 1 (18oz ) box yellow cake mix
* 1 stick of butter
* 1 cup chopped pecans
* 1/4 cup sugar

Lightly grease oblong pan (I many times just use two smaller pans - one to freeze 
and one to eat right away).  The ingredients are placed in layers:  (Do not stir 
any of the layers).

1.  spread undrained pineapple in bottom.  
2.  Add blueberries, 
3.  then 3/4 cup of sugar.  
4.  sprinkle cake mix (dry) 
5.  sprinkle pecans on top
6.  drizzle melted butter on top of pecans
7.  then sprinkle the last 1/4 cup on top of butter

Bake in oven for 25 minutes - then take a spoon and cut down through cake 
(so the mixtures kind of mix just a little (I just make about 8-10 "c" shape 
movements in the mixture).  Then return to oven for about 20 more minutes or 
until done and lightly brown.
