![Asian Salmon Bowl with Lime Drizzle](http://www.epicurious.com/images/recipesmenus/2012/2012_june/51101210.jpg)

## Ingredients

* 1 cup jasmine rice
* 2 teaspoons unsalted butter
* 1 large clove garlic, finely chopped
* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
* 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
* 3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch
* 4 salmon fillets (4 ounces each), skin removed
* 1 teaspoon canola oil
* 2 packages (5 ounces each) baby spinach
* 2 teaspoons black sesame seeds

## Directions

Heat oven to 400°F. Cook rice as directed on package. In a small saucepan, melt 
butter over medium heat. Sauté garlic and pepper flakes until garlic is lightly 
golden, 1 minute. Add syrup, juice and soy sauce; cook until bubbling, 3 
minutes. In a bowl, combine cornstarch and 1 teaspoon water; stir into garlic 
glaze. Cook until slightly thick, 1 minute. 

Arrange fillets on a foil-lined baking sheet. Spread 1 teaspoon glaze over each 
fillet. Roast until just cooked through, 12 minutes. In a medium skillet, warm 
oil over medium heat. Add 1 package spinach; sauté until just wilted. Remove 
from pan; set aside. Repeat with second package spinach. Divide rice among 4 
bowls; top each with 1/4 spinach and 1 salmon fillet, broken into large pieces. 
Drizzle with remaining sauce; sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds.
