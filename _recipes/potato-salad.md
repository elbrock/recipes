# Potato Salad

usually I use small red potatoes - if they are really small - like bite sized use 3 per person eating - otherwise use 2 per person also use one egg per person -

so here is the recipe for 4 people

- 8 medium red potatoes
- 3-4 boiled eggs
- 2-3 green onions
- 1 cup of mayo (may need more)
- 1 tsp of mustard
- salt and pepper to taste
- I also add a pinch of cayenne (two shakes, maybe three of the container)

1. wash and cut the potatoes into about 1- 1 1/2 inch pieces (I leave skin on) - for the smaller potatoes you only have to cut in half or quarter.
1. put into pot of water and bring to a  boil, once boiling set timer for about 10 min - test for done potatoes are stick a fork into it and if it breaks apart it is done - or just taste
1. while boiling potatoes do the same with the eggs.  put in pan of water, bring to boil and boil for 10 min
1. drain potatoes and put in large bowl, drain and peel eggs, dice and put into potatoes, put in mayo, mustard, cayenne and mix - add onions, salt and pepper to taste

you may have to add more mayo and mustard depending on the texture you want, I use more mayo than this.
