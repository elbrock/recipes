![Zucchini Pizza Boats](http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2016/07/21/zucchini-pizza-boats-healthy-snack/)

## Ingredients

* 6 large zucchini
* salt + pepper
* 1 cup tomato pasta sauce
* 1/2 cup shredded cheese
* optional 1/2 cup crumbled tempeh
* optional olive oil
* optional dried basil or oregano


## Directions

Cut zucchini in half, lengthwise. Then cut in half, width-wise.
Scoop out the centers with a spoon, but don’t go too far down. 
Preheat oven to 420 F, and line a baking sheet with parchment. 
If desired, rub the zucchini with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Place hollowed-sides up on the baking sheet, spoon in tomato sauce (about 1 1/2 tbsp each). 
Sprinkle on cheese. You can also sprinkle on a little dried basil or oregano if desired. 
Bake 10-20 minutes – time will vary, as some zucchini are much more watery than others. Serve while hot.
