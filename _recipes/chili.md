This recipe makes a lot of chili so you can cut in half if you want or freeze the rest. 

## Ingredients

- 2lbs of ground beef (I always use 93% or better ground beef - less fat and grease)
- one 29 oz can of tomato sauce
- one 29 ounce can of kidney beans  (with liquid)
- one 29 ounce can of pinto beans (with liquid)
- 1 cup diced onion (I always just do one medium to large white onion)
- 1/2 cup diced green chili's (I use a can of diced green chili's found by the taco stuff in         the grocery store)
- 1/4 cup diced celery (about one stalk)
- 3 medium tomatoes  chopped (I use one can of petite diced tomatoes)
- 2 teaspoons cumin powder
- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 cups of water

## Directions

1. brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, drain fat.  (if you use the 93% lean - you won't have to drain fat
2.  crumble the cooked beef into small pieces 
3.  in a large pot (like a stew pot) combine the beef and all the remaining ingredients and bring to a simmer over low heat - cook stirring every 15 min for 2-3 hrs.  (better is to whip out that crock pot, put the cooked beef in it and add all the other ingredients and put on high for 4 hrs or low for 8 hrs - you can prepare it at night and put it all in the crock pot in the frig and then go to work the next am and turn it on low - it will be ready when you get home!)

Makes about 12 servings

Tidbits:  For spicier chili, add 1/2 tsp more of black pepper, for more spice add the 1/2 tsp of black pepper and 1 tablespoon of cayenne (this will be hot!!!) or of course chop up some jalapenos - if you use these the longer the jalapenos are in the chili, the hotter it becomes.

Also I know you don't really like the tomatoes - you can either put them in a processor and blend until very fine or leave out all together!
